    `Hi, my name is Quoc Hung Nguyen (for convenience, my English name is Henry Nguyen, you can just call me Henry). Currently, 
    I'm studying my final year of the Bachelor degree of IT (Software Engineering) at University of South Australia.`,
    `As an aspiring IT student, I'm interested in solving problem, whether building a product to solve some daily problems, or 
    highly technical problems, which is why, when I don't have to study for Uni or doing any project, you might find me joining 
    some competitions (hackathons, competitive programming, algo trading, etc.). I also did a summer internship as a Fullstack 
    Software Engineer at Maptek, a mining company, so if you have any questions about the company, feel free to reach me out.`,
    `This is the place where you can find more information about me, all of my personal projects, and potentially some blog 
    posts in the future (if I have time ðŸ˜…)`,
    `I'm currently seeking for opportunities (internship, part-time/casual, or graduate) to gain industry experience in software 
    engineering, especially in web/mobile development-related areas or DevOps/SRE. So, if you know any available opportunity, 
    please feel free to get in touch, I'd appreciate that.`
