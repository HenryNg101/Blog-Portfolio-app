        Hi, my name is Quoc Hung Nguyen (That's my Vietnamese name,
        for convenience, my English name is Henry Nguyen, you can 
        just call me Henry).

        Currently, I'm studying my final year of the
        Bachelor degree of IT (Software Engineering) at University 
        of South Australia. As an aspiring IT student, I have been 
        passionate about technology since my high school, and started 
        coding since I was in my 11th grade. In the past, I used 
        to play CTFs (Capture The Flag) security competitions with 
        some other students, which inspired me to learn more about 
        information systems, how they works, which is why I have 
        more interests in system architecture and backend, compared 
        to other techs.

        I'm interested in solving problem too, whether building a product 
        to solve some daily problems, or highly technical problems, 
        which is why, when I don't have to study for Uni or doing 
        any project, you might find me joining some competitions 
        (hackathons, competitive programming, algo trading, etc.). I also did a summer 
        internship as a Fullstack Software Engineer (SWE) at Maptek, a mining company, so if you have any 
        questions about the company, feel free to reach me out.

        This is the place where you can find more information about 
        me, all of my personal projects, and potentially some blog 
        posts in the future (if I have time ðŸ˜…)
      </Typography>
      <Typography sx={{mb: 2}}>
        I'm currently seeking for opportunities (internship, 
        part-time, or graduate) to gain industry experience in 
        software engineering, especially in web/mobile 
        development or DevOps/SRE. So, if you know any available 
        opportunity, please feel free to get in touch, I'd 
        appreciate that.
